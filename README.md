# BSnipe

> `BSnipe` is a CLI packet-sniffer written by me (1sun12) in C using the Linux Sockets API.
> Must be ran using `sudo` or it will not work!

**I am not responsible for what anyone does with this tool if you download and experiment with it**, not compatible with Windows.

You are free to fork or copy my works for educational purposes! I only ask that you credit me :] !

`VERSION 1001` was written over the course of (2) weeks; roughly +(40) hours total.

All code was hand-typed. Use of A.I. was only used at the end for polish and catching unforseen bugs.

Resources used at bottom (I started with these first before starting).

## Installing

1. Clone this repository
2. Head on over to `/bin`
3. Inside you will find an already compiled Linux Binary
4. type `sudo ./packet_sniffer`

## How to Use

> Pressing `Enter` after typing a character is assumed for each option

1. Press `s` to start, `s` again to stop
2. Press `o` for options (configure the sniffer)
3. Press `e` to exit (only on home menu)
4. Press `b` to go back from the options menu to the home menu
5. To turn `TCP` to `true`, you would type `1t` as an example
6. File output is off by default, can be set to `true` in `options`

## Future Plans

If I ever come back to this project to flesh it out some more, here are some ideas I would love to add from my backlog:

- `Monitor Mode` sniffing; captures A LOT more data
- Exports everything in `.pcap` format, make it cross compatible with `WireShark` and `tcpdump`
